# Cool toggle for dark and light themes 🌙☀️

## Tools I've used

- React create app env ⚛️
- createContext Hook ⚛️
- useContext Hook ⚛️
- React Icons library ⚛️
- plain CSS 🎨

This toggle is created by using React Hooks createContext and useContext
as well as customed styles. I've used createContext and useContext in
order to omit potential props drilling between a banch of React
components in my projects.

For styling, I have used a plain CSS with before psedo-element and a
little bit of shadow as well as animations. When it comes to icons, I
have used React Icons library for moon and sun icons.
